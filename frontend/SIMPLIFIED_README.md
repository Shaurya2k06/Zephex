# Zephex - Simplified Version

## Overview
This is a simplified version of the Zephex secure messaging dApp. All unnecessary complex components, animations, and styling have been removed for a clean, functional interface.

## What's Been Fixed
1. **Removed complex UI components**: Deleted all complex layout components, sidebar, dot patterns, and animations
2. **Simplified styling**: Replaced gradient backgrounds and complex CSS with clean, simple Tailwind classes
3. **Fixed import paths**: Corrected the import paths that were using invalid `@/` aliases
4. **Streamlined structure**: Created a single-file app structure that's easier to understand and debug

## Current Features
- **Wallet Connection**: Simple MetaMask wallet connection interface
- **Basic Navigation**: Clean navigation between Dashboard, Messages, and Settings
- **Message Sending**: Functional message sending form
- **Message Display**: Simple list of received messages
- **Settings Page**: Basic wallet information display

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have MetaMask installed
2. Connect to Sepolia testnet
3. Click "Connect MetaMask" 
4. Navigate between pages using the top navigation
5. Send encrypted messages through the Messages page

## Technical Stack
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling (simple classes only)
- Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Context API for state management

## Next Steps
If you want to add features back:
1. Add features one at a time
2. Test each feature thoroughly before adding the next
3. Keep the UI simple and functional
4. Focus on core functionality over visual effects

The app should now be fully functional with a clean, simple interface that's easy to understand and debug.
